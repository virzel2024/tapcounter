// Placeholder for ocean-themed background music
// This should be gentle ambient music with ocean/water themes
// Recommended characteristics:
// - Soft synthesizer pads with wave-like motion
// - Subtle ocean wave sounds mixed very low in background
// - Flowing, liquid-like melodies
// - Blue/aquatic feeling in the harmony
// - Instruments: Soft pads, filtered synths, gentle bells, distant waves
// - Duration: 3-5 minutes (will loop seamlessly)
// - Very quiet volume (0.12 level) to not overpower tap sounds
